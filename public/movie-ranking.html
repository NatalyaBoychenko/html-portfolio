<p>The movie has a very good balance of heroism and humour, great characters' development, an interesting villain, great action-packed sequences and a big use of the CGI.</p>
<br />

<h3>2. Sully</h3>

<p>A complex, entertainning, nicely interpreted and surprisingly wonderful film that doesn't only carries the audience into a great untold story full of drama, where a tribute to an everyday hero is clearly saw.</p>
<br />

<h3>3. The Simpsons</h3>
